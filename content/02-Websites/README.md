# Inspiring corners of the Interwebz üñ•Ô∏è

If you have any suggestions or ideas for me to incorporate into this file, you can check our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md), as they indicate how you could give me a hand with this site's content. Please, **be as specific as possible**, because there are numerous sections and chapters around!

Considering that it's never easy to establish clear divisions delimitating the nature of the resources I'm proposing here, I decided to focus on the **following topics**:

1. Roadmaps.
2. Assets (free, images, sprites, SVGs, icons...).
3. APIs.
4. Inspiration.
5. Notes & Snippets.
6. Stay tuned (news & insights).
7. Tools.
8. UI.

Similarly I'll **include illustrations allowing you to check if that's the style fitting your needs**, as it might help make the decision of using certain assets easier for you!
