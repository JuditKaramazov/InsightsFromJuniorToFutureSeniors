# Certificates you can get online üèÜ

While `WDYD` (`What do you do?`) as a primary method for identification and assessment is at best _imperfect_ (not to mention that, at worst, it's simply inaccurate), it grew out of a need for efficiency. Sadly, it appears we have become defined by these titles we're so obsessed with, and although our reliance on the "what do you do?" kind of question is definitely wrong, there's nothing we can do to stop this from being the current reality we have to deal with.

Everyone **demands a title or certificate** - and so do we. Quite inevitable, given our circumstances. Whatever the case, if you are indeed looking for a **curated list of free, online, and certified courses** allowing you to prove that you indeed covered the required knowledge required to land a job, let me tell you that you arrived at the right place!

As I previously expressed, I indeed **considered including badged courses** since they cover a range of core subjects and professional competencies essential for modern workplaces. However, right now I am sharing **certified courses only** - but even that might change in the future!

Until this hypothetical future arrives, let's have a look at the many free tools the Interwebz put at our disposal!

Although I took the time to collect the links, data, and duration, and then gathered everything in this beautiful place (which cost me quite some time and brain cells, to be honest with you), all the content belongs to their respective authors.

Thank you for your time, dear learner! Oh, and remember that you can make the certified Dinosaur extremely happy if you...
