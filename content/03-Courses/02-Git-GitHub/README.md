# Git gut at Git: A hub ‚õ∫üõñ‚õ∫

Now that I can gently welcome you to this `Git and GitHub little course`, allow me to emphasize that the naming convention surrounding programming languages and resources is, generally speaking, _anything_ but intuitive. Have you been scolded after confusing Java with JavaScript yet, for instance? Are they connected in some way, or is the connection merely superficial? If you are wondering what's the case situation with Git and GitHub, you came to the right place; just like you, we all found ourselves quite confused as soon as these concepts made an appearance.

Although it's more than frequent to find articles featuring detailed and complex diagrams with tons of arrows pointing everywhere in order to explain this technology, we'll try our best to **keep things as simple as possible here**. Sadly, **the technical documentation on Git usually feels unapproachable for a beginner**, with a special focus on developers who already have a strong handle on programming theory. That's not what we'd want to achieve. Surely, we'll offer **key concepts for both beginners and experienced developers**, but there's no way we'll leave any of you behind.

That said, and _only_ when you feel comfortable enough with all the concepts we'll explore, you should definitely [check out Git's technical documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), as it will provide you with excellent insight on the matter. However, I'd suggest **leaving the original documentation aside from now**, as it might feel overwhelming and, eventually, frustrating.

There are tons of resources out there, and the fact that **a certain type of documentation doesn't work for us shouldn't become the kind of heavy and discouraging load we can't overcome**! We all understand things in different ways, and as far as you keep going, all of them are fine.
