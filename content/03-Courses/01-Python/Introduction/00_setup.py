"""
Welcome to our preparatory Module (or Lesson), future Pythonese speakers!

As it's mandatory, we'll cover the basics of Python programming language,
including how to install Python and set up a development environment.
Also, if you need some extra information like guides or visual
approaches to these concepts, don't forget that you'll always find useful
links at the very end of each module.
That said, let's dive in!

# Installing Python
"""
'But... What is Python, even? Is it valid for web development, is it
a useful language these days?'
Python is a versatile programming language used for various purposes,
including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
Before we begin coding in Python, we need to install it on our system.
If you're tempted to ask why you should use it, allow me to give you some
reasons:

1. Python has a simple syntax, similar to the English language. Accessible!
2. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed 
    as soon as it is written. Quick prototyping time!
3. Python works on several platforms, like Mac, Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi...
    Quite versatile!
4. Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines 
    than some other programming languages. Efficient!
5. Python is flexible: 
    - web development, 
    - data analytics, 
    - machine learning, 
    - data science, 
    - data engineering...

Did I convince you? Great! If that's the case, let's now follow these steps 
in order to install Python:

1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.
2. Navigate to the Downloads section.
3. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Download the installer and run it.
5. Follow the installation instructions, ensuring that Python is added to your PATH environment variable.
6. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing 'python --version'.
   You should see the installed Python version displayed.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Python on your system.
Now, let's move on to setting up a development environment.

# Setting up a Development Environment
"""
To write and execute Python code efficiently, it's essential to set up a development environment.
A development environment typically includes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor,
along with other tools for managing Python packages and dependencies.

1. IDEs (Integrated Development Environments):
   - PyCharm: A popular IDE for Python development, offering features like code completion, debugging, and version control integration.
   - Visual Studio Code (VSCode): A lightweight yet powerful code editor with excellent support for Python and various extensions.
   - Jupyter Notebook: An interactive notebook environment for data science and exploratory computing, ideal for learning Python interactively.

2. Text Editors:
   - Sublime Text: A simple and customizable text editor with Python support through plugins.
   - Atom: A hackable text editor with a rich ecosystem of packages for Python development.
   - Notepad++: A lightweight text editor for Windows with syntax highlighting and plugin support.

Choose an IDE or text editor that suits your preferences and workflow.
Once you've selected your development environment, install it and configure it for Python development.
Additionally, consider setting up virtual environments for managing Python dependencies and project isolation.

    - Video tutorial (playlist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EB8siO-_OM&list=PLCTHcU1KoD98IeuVcqJ2rt1FNytfR_C90

That's it for setting up a development environment! You're now ready to start coding in Python, so...
What are we waiting for? Let's keep going!
