# Python Cheatsheetsss 🐍

Should I slow down with the memes? Should I, shouldn't I...? I must admit that sometimes, I simply can't deny myself the pleasure - and Python is making it strangely easy. Anyway: as you can imagine, this is our `🐍 Python's 🐍` **main hub**, **operations room**, **nexus**, **Firelink Shrine**, and **sanctuary**. Why? This is the file granting you access to the entirety of the cheatsheets that I prepared (_or that I am still preparing_) for you.

If by any chance you can't find a link redirecting you to each section, it means that **the content is still not available**. As for the rest, and since I am aware of the density of the content itself, I also added a short description of the elements you'll find per chapter.
