# Git (gud) Cheatsheets 🧠🔄

Is the Git Gud meme getting old now that programmers can use it as well? Perhaps coding became the new Dark Souls of Dark Souls. Anyway, guys: **welcome to** `🌳 Git's 🌳` **hub** (_no pun intended..._), with its many branches included and restricting our sight... Until now! Why? From now on, you'll have access to some of the **most common and useful Git commands** - and they will remain all in one place: this one! Should we start considering this repository a _real_ sanctuary, allowing us to spread the brilliant Words of Human Knowledge?

Don't forget that if you can't find a link redirecting you to each section, then **the content is still not available**. As for the content that's indeed ready, and since I am aware of the density of the content itself, I also added a short description of the elements you'll find per chapter.

These words live under the already-very-git-and-very-gud structure of the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt), but of course, I do not own any specific links or images that you may find included in my work; the only exceptions will be properly specified. As you should know by now, I _don't usually choose violence_ after waking up, and that's why I always mention the original author, as it is crucial to preserve the integrity of people's work; this glorious teaser image displaying our dearly beloved Git Gud meme, for instance, was found in the shape of a sticker in [ThirstyMag](https://thirstymag.com/). Simply amazing!

As for the rest, thank you kindly to all the people referenced from now on! Oh, and remember that if you found this file noteworthy, you can make the Dinosaur extremely happy if you...
